hex version 0.1, mostly by Schnux

A modification for Minetest (https://www.minetest.net ) which provides prisms with a hexagonal base area which behave similar to nodes.
See license.txt for license information.

How to install:
Decompress the folder where this document is inside, if necessary, rename it to "hex", if necessary (that is how it should already be called), and put it into the "mods" subfolder of your Minetest folder.
(If you only want this to be used in a single world, place the folder in worldmods/ in your world directory.)

If you don't have the Minetest game engine (and therefore also not the Minetest folder), you can download the official version on https://www.minetest.net.
To run this modification, you also have to have a game to be run inside the engine (probably "Minetest Game") which should be included by default when you download the engine.
